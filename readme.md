## The main goal of the challenge is to **create a Transfer Hook Vault**.

### Key Requirements

- The vault must be a **single vault** where **only whitelisted users** can interact.
- The solution should handle both **depositing and removing funds**.
- The token must be **minted within the program**.
- Initial implementation should use a `Vec` for the whitelist (Pubkey and amount),
  - with a note to try different solutions like a **PDA** later.
- You are required to **test everything with LiteSVM**.
- You need to **add another extension of your choice**.
